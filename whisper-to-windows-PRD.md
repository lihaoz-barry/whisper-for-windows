# Project Requirements Document: Whisper Transcriber Application  

The following table outlines the detailed functional requirements of the Whisper Transcriber application.  

| Requirement ID | Description | User Story | Expected Behavior/Outcome |  
|----------------|-------------|------------|--------------------------|  
| FR001 | Creating a New Transcription | As a user, I want to be able to start a new transcription so I can begin converting my audio files to text. | The system should provide a clear way for the user to initiate a new transcription, potentially presenting an empty workspace or an "add new file" button. |  
| FR002 | Adding Audio Files | As a user, I want to be able to select or drag-and-drop audio files into the application so I can process them for transcription. | The system should provide a file browser or drag-and-drop area for users to add audio files. Upon selection, the file should be added to the workspace. |  
| FR003 | Viewing Audio File Details | As a user, I want to be able to see details about my selected audio files so I can confirm I've chosen the correct files. | The system should display the list of added audio files, showing filename, duration, format, and size. |  
| FR004 | Selecting Transcription Model | As a user, I want to be able to choose which Whisper model to use so I can balance accuracy against speed. | The system should provide a dropdown or option set allowing users to select from tiny, base, small, medium, and large Whisper models with clear indications of the tradeoffs. |  
| FR005 | Starting Transcription Process | As a user, I want to be able to initiate the transcription process with a single click so I can easily convert my audio to text. | The system should provide a prominent "Transcribe" button that, when clicked, begins processing the selected audio files using the chosen model. |  
| FR006 | Monitoring Transcription Progress | As a user, I want to see the progress of ongoing transcriptions so I know how much longer I need to wait. | The system should display a progress bar and status messages showing the current operation and completion percentage during transcription. |  
| FR007 | Viewing Transcription Results | As a user, I want to see the transcribed text immediately after processing so I can review the output. | The system should display the transcribed text in a preview pane once transcription is complete. |  
| FR008 | Saving Transcription Results | As a user, I want to save my transcriptions to various file formats so I can use them in different applications. | The system should allow saving transcriptions as plain text (.txt), subtitle files (.srt), or documents (.docx) with a save dialog. |  
| FR009 | Setting Transcription Parameters | As a user, I want to configure transcription settings so I can customize the output to my needs. | The system should provide settings for language selection, timestamp inclusion, and formatting options accessible through a settings panel. |  
| FR010 | Batch Processing | As a user, I want to transcribe multiple files in one operation so I can process a collection of recordings efficiently. | The system should allow selecting multiple files and process them sequentially, showing progress for each file and the overall batch. |  
| FR011 | Editing Transcription Results | As a user, I want to be able to edit transcription results so I can correct any errors before exporting. | The system should provide an editable text area where users can modify the transcribed text before saving. |  
| FR012 | Managing Transcription History | As a user, I want to access my previous transcriptions so I can refer back to them without reprocessing. | The system should maintain a history of recent transcriptions that users can access, view, and reopen. |  
| FR013 | Detecting Audio Language | As a user, I want the system to automatically detect the language in my audio so I don't have to specify it manually. | The system should analyze the audio and determine the spoken language with >90% accuracy, or default to manual selection if uncertain. |  
| FR014 | Including Timestamps | As a user, I want timestamps in my transcription so I can easily navigate to specific points in the original audio. | The system should include timestamp markers at configurable intervals (paragraph, sentence, or word level) in the transcription output. |  
| FR015 | Handling Different Audio Formats | As a user, I want to transcribe various audio formats so I don't need to convert files beforehand. | The system should support MP3, WAV, M4A, FLAC, and OGG file formats without requiring external conversion. |
